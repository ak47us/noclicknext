# About this repo
- This repo holds the code for the browser extension.
- The browser extension talks to a centralized back-end server that processes the multi-page article.
- After clicking the browser button, the user is shown a new tab with the entire contents of the article.
- This also removes non-content information, like ads and navigation menus.
